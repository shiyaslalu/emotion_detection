# Emotion Detection with Machine Learning
This repository contains code and resources for a simple emotion detection project using machine learning techniques. The goal of this project is to classify facial expressions into one of several basic emotions, such as happiness, sadness, anger, surprise, etc.

Overview
Emotion detection, also known as facial expression recognition, is a fascinating application of machine learning that has numerous real-world applications. In this project, we utilize a dataset of facial images labeled with different emotions to train a convolutional neural network (CNN) model for emotion classification.

Dataset
The dataset used for this project is the FER2013 dataset, which contains grayscale images of facial expressions categorized into seven different emotions: anger, disgust, fear, happiness, sadness, surprise, and neutral.

Requirements
Python 3
TensorFlow
Keras
OpenCV
NumPy
Matplotlib

# To use our Emotion Detection Model
  1. Just clone or download and unzip our resporatory
  2. install tensorflow and cv2 in the system using pip
  3.run the gui.py file
  4.upload the image in the gui
  5. click on the Detect button to detect the emotion
